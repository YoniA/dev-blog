Welcome to my personal blog!

My name is Yoni, and I am a fullstack developer based in Jerualem.

I hold B.Sc degree in Computer Science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

I find myself particularly attracted to the Linux ecosystem, building shell scripts using command line tools like curl, sed, awk, vim etc, and the infinite possibilities to combine them to
create great things.

For any questions feel free to drop me a line: themarketwizard1@gmail.com.
